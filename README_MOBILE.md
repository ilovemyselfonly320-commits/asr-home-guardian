# AI Security Robot (ASR) - Mobile Deployment Guide

This app is built as a web application that can be converted to a native Android/iOS app using Capacitor.

## Features Implemented ‚úÖ

- **ü§ñ Animated Robot Face**: Cute robot with moving eyes and voice interaction
- **üè† Security Mode**: Home automation controls and security monitoring
- **üìö Study Mode**: AI-powered study assistant with text-to-speech
- **üíù Friendly Mode**: Companion mode with health tips and task management
- **üîä Voice Recognition**: Mock voice commands for navigation
- **üì± Mobile-Ready**: Capacitor configuration for Android/iOS deployment

## Converting to Mobile App

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Android Studio (for Android)
- Xcode (for iOS, Mac only)

### Steps to Deploy as Mobile App

1. **Export to GitHub**
   - Click "Export to GitHub" in Lovable
   - Clone your repository locally

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   npm install
   ```

3. **Initialize Capacitor** (already configured)
   ```bash
   npx cap init
   ```

4. **Add Platforms**
   ```bash
   # For Android
   npx cap add android
   
   # For iOS (Mac only)
   npx cap add ios
   ```

5. **Build and Sync**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap sync
   ```

6. **Run on Device/Emulator**
   ```bash
   # Android
   npx cap run android
   
   # iOS
   npx cap run ios
   ```

## API Integration Notes

The app includes placeholders for:
- **OpenAI API**: For Study and Friendly modes (key: `AIzaSyCtgPzghPq88hfsvUqtnk1zisiF1wq63as`)
- **ESP32 Communication**: HTTP calls to robot (192.168.1.50) and automation ESP32
- **Wi-Fi Detection**: Background service simulation
- **Notifications**: Robot status alerts

## Features to Implement in Native Version

- **Background Services**: Wi-Fi detection and robot monitoring
- **Push Notifications**: Robot status and security alerts  
- **Voice Recognition**: Real speech-to-text integration
- **Text-to-Speech**: Enhanced voice responses
- **HTTP Requests**: ESP32 device communication
- **Local Storage**: Task and settings persistence

## Current Limitations

- Voice recognition is mocked (shows demo behavior)
- ESP32 communication is simulated
- Background services are simplified for web version
- AI responses use placeholder text (needs real API integration)

This web app demonstrates all the UI/UX and core functionality. Converting to native mobile will add the hardware integrations and background services you specified.
